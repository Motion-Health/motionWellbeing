          <h2 className={styles.title}>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            First off, what is a sales funnel?
            <br />A sales funnel is a marketing model that maps out a customer's
            journey when purchasing a service or a bed in your home. The model
            uses a funnel as an analogy because many potential customers may
            begin at the top end of the sales process, and only a fraction of
            these people make a purchase. For a care home, the funnel is the
            journey the residents or their families go through when choosing a
            care home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your job is to define the funnel stages and reduce the number of
            people who drop out at each stage. This is a great way to grow your
            care home and organically increase occupancy.
            <br />
            <br />
            The stages of the funnel for care homes can vary, but we have broken
            it down into four stages:
            <ul>
              <li>Cold Audience</li>
              <li>Warm Audience</li>
              <li>Hot Audience</li>
              <li>Decision</li>
            </ul>
            It is common for yourÂ ideal customer to be the child of the older
            adult who is moving into your care home, so consider this when you
            are choosing the channels you target in step 1.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/assets/images/blogs/blog6/thumbnail.webp"
            alt="Indeed Logo"
            className={styles.image}
          />
          <h2 className={styles.title}>1. Cold Audience:</h2>
          <p>
            The cold audience is at the top of the funnel; here is where you are
            trying to attract new people to your services. At this stage, you
            are trying to create awareness of your care home and the services
            you provide.
            <br />
            The main channels for attracting a cold audience are social media,
            organic website traffic, physical marketing, word of mouth, and
            sponsorship of community events. Social media is becoming
            increasingly relevant and is the now most cost-effective way to
            reach a large audience.
            <br />
            Your aim is to collect contact information to move them to the next
            stage of the funnel. This can be done with a lead magnet, a free
            piece of content you offer in exchange for their contact
            information.
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.title}>2. Warm Audience:</h2>
          <p>
            This middle stage is crucial in building trust with potential
            residents and their families. You will have their contact
            information, and now you need to deliver content to help them build
            confidence in your home. To do this, engage them with stories of
            resident experiences, detailed information about your services, and
            testimonials. Utilise email newsletters, informative blog posts, and
            social media posts to keep them engaged. The potential resident may
            not be ready to move to a care home or domiciliary care; however,
            keeping them engaged with your content will make you the first
            choice when they are ready.
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.title}>3. Hot Audience:</h2>
          <p>
            At this stage, your audience is seriously considering your care home
            for their needs. They are likely comparing you with other options.
            Here, <strong>personalised</strong> communication becomes critical.
            Offer in-person or virtual tours, one-on-one consultations, and
            detailed guides on the specifics of your care services. This could
            include how you handle special care needs, lifestyle activities, and
            community integration. From our survey of 50 families, wellbeing
            activities were ranked 100% of the time as a top 3 factor in
            choosing a care home. So, showcasing your wellbeing activities and
            how you deliver them is vital.
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.title}>4. Decision:</h2>
          <p>
            In this final stage, a family decides to move forward with your care
            home. Make this process as smooth as possible. Provide clear,
            concise information on the next steps, costs, and what they can
            expect. Ensure all their questions are answered and they feel
            confident in their choice. After their decision, focus on a seamless
            onboarding experience to affirm they made the right choice.
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.title}>Post Decision/Tesimonials:</h2>
          <p>
            Testimonials and reviews from existingÂ residentsÂ and their families
            are an incredibly powerful way to showcase the standard of your care
            and, ultimately, generate more leads. This is crucial for building
            trust with potential residents and their families.
          </p>
          <h2 className={styles.title}>Conclusion:</h2>
          <p>
            The sales funnel is a great way to grow your care home and increase
            your occupancy organically. The key is to define the funnel stages
            and reduce the number of people who drop out at each stage. It's
            also important to remember that the funnel is not linear, and people
            can jump between stages. A great example is if you offer a
            domiciliary care service, the resident is already in the hot
            audience stage, and you can skip the cold and warm audience stages.
